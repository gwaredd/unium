# Unium
> A library for game automation.

Unium is an library for [unity](https://unity.com/) that facilities automation. It exposes an HTTP API that can be used for tools or testing.

There are two parts:

* A web server that is embedded into the game
* A query language sits on top that lets you search and manipulate the scene graph

This provides a flexible interface so you can remotely control and inspect your game as it runs. If necessary, you can add your own endpoints to the underlying web server to do custom operations.
